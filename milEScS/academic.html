    <h2>The Journey</h2>
    <div class="text">
        I started my journey in academic life unstable because 
        I transfer with different schools. 
        I finished my kindergarten at Poblacion Elementary School and after I transfer to 
        Central Elementary School to continue grade 1. As my parents parted away my study is greatly affected 
        and it makes me transfer to another school which is from our Island. I continued my Grade 1 at 
        Tungasan Elementary School because I only took half of the quarter when I was on the Mainland.
         I have honed my skill and mentality there as I've thrive with my grandparents and not dependant
          on my parents at very young age. I graduated as valedictorian and continued my High School at 
          Sta. Rosa National High School. During my high school days, I've received different certificates 
          pertaining to my academic and extracurricular achievements and I've made lot of memories on there.
           I took Accountancy Business and Management (ABM) during my Senior High School at 
           Nemesio Epifania Taneo Memorial High School despite the fact that Math subject is  my enemy and 
           commonly taught on this strand, I still ranked as with honors. Currently, I'm on college level 
           taking up Bachelor of Science in Industrial Technology and I know it is just a start for another 
           journey ahead. <br><br>
