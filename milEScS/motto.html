    <h1>Motto</h1>
    <div class="motto">
        One of the saying that I've live up to is, " Everything happens for a reason". 
        My eyes are already open since I was a child and I already experience lot of hardships and 
        I believe that there's a reason for that. My parents are already divorced and I believe there's a 
        reason for that. I am not taking my ideal course which is about medicine and I also believe why 
        God didn't let me have it. Whether we like it or not, life will still continue regardless to the 
        path we take and to the choice we've made. Maybe there's something about that choice that will affect 
        our future and maybe there's something about what you've planned for that is not suitable for you. 
        Let His plans provide reasons to our doubts, let's just keep on moving.
