Since I was a child, I'm into basketball because most of my peers play this sport.
 I love watching NBA and it make idolize lot of athletes just like Kevin Durant and Draymond Green.
  I play basketball barefoot not intimated by the heat of the sun and dirt beneath my foot, 
  It makes me feel healthy and enjoyed. I've already played for our school in different events 
  just like intramurals wherein we are the champions in basketball tournament and also outside the school 
  basketball events. I am fond of playing billiards also, and it was introduced by my friend. 
  I play chess and badminton during my middle childhood and this game and sports helps me gain lot of 
  friends be acquainted with them. I spend most of my time doing school works and doing nothing when 
  there's nothing to do. I am very conscious about my body that's why I'm very into sports and planning to
   gain some muscles when given lot of time. I am interested on anime and I have lot of stickers especially on
    Dragonball and Slamdunk, it awakes my childish being. I always watch anime until now because it has no age 
    limit and boundary. I love the color of gray because for me it is a mixture of good and bad, it reminds me
     that we must not provide everything pleasant to them because it will lead to abuse. One of the things 
     that I can't resist is food, 
 I can't help myself but to devour what's in front of me and my favorite food is pinakbet and icecream.
 I prioritize my studies on this times to have a better future.
